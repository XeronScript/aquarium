This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the pocketbase server:

```bash
./pocketbase serve
```

Then run node developement server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. And voil√† you can now start managing your aquariums! Not really but it's still in developement... 
Maybe one day it will be working smoothly and not look like
piece of junk :D


###### This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Roboto, a custom Google Font.
